# About This Repo
This is a shell rails project that has the same configuration as the project EOS uses in the coding exercise repo.

Please make sure you have all of the dependencies set up before the interview to give you more time to work on the sample app during the interview.

# About the Coding Exercise

**The exercise will help us:**
* Evaluate coding style and method.
* See how you communicate.
* Demonstrate your ability to read and evaluate legacy code.

**Just like in the real world, during the coding exercise you will:**
* Be given some requirements (hint: they might be in the readme file).
* Work on a project someone else has started, so some of the work will have been done already.
* You'll be working with mostly Rails, HTML, and jQuery.
* Ask loads of questions -- no points taken off. Seriously, not asking questions might indicate a problem.
* Look things up on the internet, pull from your magic bag on Github.
* Not worry about finishing the project. Finishing is not the goal of this exercise and time is short. Work well, not fast.

**What's not like the real world:**
* What is there works. There are no known bugs you need to fix or code that needs to be refactored.
* It's time to talk through what you're doing _out loud_. EOS staff can do almost anything, except read minds.

**To prepare your system**
1. git clone https://github.com/eoschools/coding_exercise_prep
1. cd coding_exercise_prep
1. bundle install
1. yarn install --check-files
1. rails db:create

You may delete the project after you have successfully completed these steps. Your system ready for the coding exercise.

Hint: This project uses SQLite3. [Case-insensitive searches in SQLite](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2220595/402870) are easy.

Good luck!
